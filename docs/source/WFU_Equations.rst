Waveform Differences
--------------------
Amplitude difference is defined generally as:

.. math::

    \begin{equation}
        \Delta{A}=\frac{|h_{1}|-|h_{2}|}{|h_{1}|}
    \end{equation}

Where :math:`h_{1}` and :math:`h_{2}` are sets of gravitational wave strain, which are complex. Amplitude difference is a relative error between the two waveforms relative to :math:`h_{1}`.
